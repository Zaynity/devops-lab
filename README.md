# DevOps Lab Environment

Welcome to my personal DevOps lab repository. This space is designed for experimentation and learning around modern DevOps tooling, infrastructure automation, and CI/CD practices.

This project is evolving over time as I integrate and test different technologies and workflows. For now, the setup includes a basic Kubernetes cluster with a local Docker registry and a documentation website.
